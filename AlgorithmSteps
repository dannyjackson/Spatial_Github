Algorithm for testing species niche differences

1. Obtain the dataset
2. Filter the dataset
    A. Select only one observation of each species per grid cell in the model
        I. When permuting the data, I should permute before selecting an observation per grid cell
    B. Remove correlated environmental layers
3. Testing differences in extent
    A. In ENMTools, I can test IF there is a significant difference in extent

    B. But to test where there is a difference (because we hypothesize that there isn't a difference across the overall range but only in the city), I need to write an algorithm to solve this
    See file RangeTesting.sh and accompanying files 
4. Testing differences in predictive variables

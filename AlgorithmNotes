Algorithm for testing species niche differences

1. Obtain the dataset
2. Filter the dataset
    A. Select only one observation of each species per grid cell in the model
        I. When permuting the data, I should permute before selecting an observation per grid cell
    B. Remove correlated environmental layers
        I. Discuss this with Jay Taylor -- is it necessary/important for step 4?
3. Testing differences in extent
    A. This can be done in ENMTools

4. Testing differences in predictive variables
